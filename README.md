# CanSat
Code for CanSat Portugal 2023

A CanSat is a simulation of a real satellite, integrated within the volume and shape of a soft drinks can. The challenge for the students is to fit all the major subsystems found in a satellite, such as power, sensors and a communication system, into this minimal volume. The CanSat is then launched by a rocket up to an altitude of approximately one kilometre, or dropped from a platform, drone or captive balloon. Then its mission begins. This involves carrying out a scientific experiment and/or a technology demonstration, achieving a safe landing, and analysing the data collected.

Our team, CanACork, is participating in the final of CanSat Portugal 2023, in which only 15 portuguese teams pass through the final. The winner will then represent Portugal in the European Competition. 

Primary and secondary CanSat missions
1. Primary mission
To measure, after release and during descent, the following parameters:
  • Air temperature
  • Air pressure
and transmit these data as telemetry to the ground station at least once every second During the post-flight analysis, it must be possible for the team to analyse the data obtained (for example, make a calculation of altitude) and display it in graphs (for example, altitude vs. time and temperature vs. altitude).

2. Secondary mission
Our satellite will be eco-friendly, therefore, we chose to make it out of cork instead of plastic. Cork also has a lot of different properties which are perfect for our mission, such as being extremely resistant, weightless, thermic isolator, etc. We also decided to not waste the heat produced by the components, therefore, since cork is an extremely good isolator, we are using a thermoelectric generator in order to apply the Seebeck effect to produce energy out of heat.
