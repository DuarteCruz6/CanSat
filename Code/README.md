#### Eletronical components:
- 2 sensors BMP280 by AdaFruit (one needs to be soldered on SDO)
- 1 INA219 multimeter by AdaFruit
- 1 APC220 Radio Communication Module 
- 1 Arduino Nano Every

#### Our mission:
- Reading temperature, atmospheric pressure and altitude on both BMP280
- Reading voltage produced by the thermoelectric generator with the help of INA219
- Sending these values to our ground-station constituted by 2 antennas Yagi-Uda
